Uber Tic-Tac is a two player game. Unlike regular tic tac toe though, there are THREE 3x3 boards, which can be unlocked under different circumstances.

**Where it all started**

Tic tac toe is a game that is easy to teach and easy to play; you just need two people, a piece of paper, and a writing utensil. Therefore, I decided to put a fun twist to this classic game that's as easily teachable as the original game, but a little more complex gameplay.
