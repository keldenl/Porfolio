MB Personality Matcher takes in data about the Myers-Briggs results of people and then outputs information about who are compatible and not compatible based on their personality type.

**How MB Personality Matcher all began**

I always found personality quizzes fun, it was exciting to answer questions about yourself and getting results that told me more about myself. Whether it was what type of Disney princess I was or where my best vacation spot would be. However, it wasn't until the club I was in at school made every one of our officers take the Myers-Brigg test and then share it to every in the club in hopes of getting to know each other more that I realized we didn't do much with the information that we get back from these personality tests. Thus, I decided to make a Myer's-Briggs Personality Matcher to add another aspect to taking the Myers-Briggs test. Similar to the enthusiasm people would get when finding out their results from the test, it was equally, if not more, exciting to see who they matched up with. This not only provided a fun talking point with other people in the club, but also brought everyone closer together.
