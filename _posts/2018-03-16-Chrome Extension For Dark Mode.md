This is a Chrome Extension that can be easily added to any Chrome Browser and turns all your webpages in Chrome into dark mode with a click of a button.

**Where the idea came from**

Various applications have an option to have dark mode, but for the ones that don't, switching between light and dark mode because lack of implementation always was a bad experience. I decided to make a dark mode extension for Chrome that could universally switch any webpage to dark mode.
