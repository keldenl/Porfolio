A sketchpad that anybody can use with just a browser. I wanted to bring my Processing sketches online, so I decided to learn p5.js â€“ a open source project that does just that.

<br>
**Where it all started**

I learned about Processing when my brother, a designer, started using it to make small personal projects. I liked doodling sometimes, so this is the project that resulted from it.

<br>
**Abstract Brush?**

The abstract brush takes in the current location of the cursor and adjusts its width and height based on it. It can lead to interesting doodles for sure. The provided color scheme also makes it easy to blend in the art.

<br>
**Code & Demo**

It wasn't a complicated project at all, but it was a interesting experience to work with p5.js for the first time and realizing its flexibility.

Here's a [demo](../download/OnlineSketchpad/source-code/) of it, and download the source code [here](../download/OnlineSketchpad/source-code.zip).
