Web Tools is a web tool website resulting from a collection of multiple useful tools that can be used on the desktop, laptop, or mobile smartphone.

**Where it all started**

There are many simple apps that someone might need and use often that can be accessed from both the web and apps. However, oftentimes, if someone uses multiple apps a lot, they have to switch between windows or applications since each app only does one thing. So I decided to create a centralized place where someone can access all these apps at once without having to worry about switching between each one. The current tools on the app a combination of tools I use a lot or just ones I thought were fun to play with.
