This is a Chrome Extension that can be easily added to any Chrome Browser and turns all your webpages in Chrome into dark mode with a click of a button.

**Where the idea came from**
![First look](../images/posts/{{ page.title }}-0.jpg)

Various applications have an option to have dark mode, but for the ones that don't, switching between light and dark mode because lack of implementation always was a bad experience. I decided to make a dark mode extension for Chrome that could universally switch any webpage to dark mode.

<br>
**How it works**

“Chrome Dark Mode” does exactly what the title implies – it changes your webpages’ styles to a slick dark mode websites nowadays rock. Not only that, it will also collect the user’s preference on dark mode based on the data from user usage, and smarty understand and therefore nicely graph that collected information. As a stretch goal, I could possibly even adapt and learn from that collected data and as a feature turn on and off the extension based on the user’s preferences and habits.
