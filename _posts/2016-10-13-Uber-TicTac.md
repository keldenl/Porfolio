Uber Tic-Tac is a two player game. Unlike regular tic tac toe though, there are THREE 3x3 boards, which can be unlocked under different circumstances.

**Where it all started**

Tic tac toe is a game that is easy to teach and easy to play; you just need two people, a piece of paper, and a writing utensil. Therefore, I decided to put a fun twist to this classic game that's as easily teachable as the original game, but a little more complex gameplay.

<br>
**How it works**

The first move will have to be made on the center board. Depending on the column the player places their turn (left, middle, or right), the next player's board will be unlocked. (i.e. If player 1 places on the left column, player 2 would HAVE to play on the left board, etc).

The first player to win tic tac toe on ONE board wins.
