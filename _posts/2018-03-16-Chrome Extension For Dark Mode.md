This is a Chrome Extension that can be easily added to any Chrome Browser and turns everything in Chrome into dark mode with a click of a button.

**Where the idea came from**

A lot of applications have an option to have dark mode. However, I always thought that was inconvenient since every time I had to switch applications or open a new application, I'd have to set each application individually to dark mode using their respective settings. Then, when I wanted to go out of dark mode, I'd have to go to each application again and then turn off dark mode. Therefore, I decided to make a dark mode extension for Chrome that could be universal, eliminating the need to constantly switch to dark mode and back.
