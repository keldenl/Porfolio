**How Treat all began**

With our hectic schedules, to-do list apps have become increasingly popular to keep track of everything we have to do; from simple things such as doing our laundry to important presentations at work, our lives are filled with many things that we have to do in our day-to-day lives. However, many to-do list apps simply make a list of all the things that I had to do, not giving us much incentive to do those things. Thus, when my group-consisting of chronic procrastinators-was put together for our iOS programming class, we knew almost immediately what to make. We wanted to make a to-do list app that not only organizes what we need to do, but also gives us an incentive to do those things. Treat is different from other to-do list apps in that it lets you reward yourself for the tasks you do. Every task that is added can be set to a difficulty level, and the harder the difficulty level, the more points you get when that task is completed. In addition to adding tasks, you can also add rewards that can be "purchased" using the points you accumulated from finishing tasks to Treat yourself!
